    On behalf of my wife and I, we would like to sincerely thank Dr. Duan, Mrs. Amy Hu, and you for the time you spent developing a distribution plan for our new floral operation. We have incorporated it into our operation and it appears to have significantly reduced our travel time and expenses in distribution our products to the Marvin Stores chain. Hopefully this will be an on-going study and we will be able to "tweak" or alter the system based on your recommendations as our business grows. Again, thank you for your help. It is very much appreciated.
