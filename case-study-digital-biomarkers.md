## Engagement Snapshot
- **Client**: Confidential Fortune 50 biopharma portfolio team  
- **Duration**: 16-week roadmap + managed analytics extension  
- **Team**: Principal strategist, pharmacometrics lead, data engineer, product manager

## Challenge
Clinical operations needed a unified view of sensor-derived endpoints to inform trial design and regulatory packages. Legacy spreadsheets and vendor portals could not scale across indications or withstand audit requirements.

## Our Approach
1. **Operating Model Blueprint** – Conducted stakeholder workshops (clinical, regulatory, data science) to define governance, success metrics, and evidence standards.  
2. **Reusable Data Foundation** – Stood up ingestion pipelines for wearable and assay data with automated quality checks, metadata lineage, and de-identification safeguards.  
3. **Model Factory Enablement** – Built probabilistic models in Stan/Torsten with packaged validation harnesses so teams could reuse components across cohorts.  
4. **Executive Readouts** – Delivered interactive decision dashboards, scenario simulations, and a submission-ready evidence library.

## Outcomes
- **6× faster** time to cohort insights compared with the prior release cycle.  
- Regulatory reviewers adopted the evidence pack as the template for adjacent programs.  
- Engagement evolved into a managed analytics pod supporting post-market surveillance.
