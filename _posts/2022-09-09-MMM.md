## Bayesian methods for media mix modeling with carryover and shape effects.
by Jin Y, Wang Y, Sun Y, Chan D, Koehler J. 

Media mix models are used by advertisers to measure the effectiveness of their advertising and provide insight in making future budget allocation decisions. Advertising usually has lag effects and diminishing returns, which are hard to capture using linear regression. In this paper, we propose a media mix model with flexible functional forms to model the carryover and shape effects of advertising. The model is estimated using a Bayesian approach in order to make use of prior knowledge accumulated in previous or related media mix models. We illustrate how to calculate attribution metrics such as ROAS and mROAS from posterior samples on simulated data sets. Simulation studies show that the model can be estimated very well for large size data sets, but prior distributions have a big impact on the posteriors when the sample size is small and may lead to biased estimates. We apply the model to data from a shampoo advertiser, and use Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to choose the appropriate specification of the functional forms for the carryover and shape effects. We further illustrate that the optimal media mix based on the model has a large variance due to the variance of the parameter estimates.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Media Mix Modeling},
by David Chan and Mike Perry

{: .box-note}

Advertisers have a need to understand the effectiveness of their media spend in driving sales in order to optimize budget allocations. Media mix models are a common and widely used approach for doing so. The paper outlines the various challenges such models encounter in consistently providing valid answers to the advertiserâ€™s questions on media effectiveness. The paper also discusses opportunities for improvements in media mix models that can produce better inference.

## Bayesian Modeling of Marketing Attribution
 

{: .box-warning}
In a multi-channel marketing world, the purchase decision journey encounters many interactions (e.g., email, mobile notifications, display advertising, social media, and so on). These impressions have direct (main effects), as well as interactive influence on the final decision of the customer. To maximize conversions, a marketer needs to understand how each of these marketing efforts individually and collectively affect the customer's final decision. This insight will help her optimize the advertising budget over interacting marketing channels. This problem of interpreting the influence of various marketing channels to the customer's decision process is called marketing attribution. We propose a Bayesian model of marketing attribution that captures established modes of action of advertisements, including the direct effect of the ad, decay of the ad effect, interaction between ads, and customer heterogeneity. Our model allows us to incorporate information from customer's features and provides usable error bounds for parameters of interest, like the ad effect or the half-life of an ad. We apply our model on a real-world dataset and evaluate its performance against alternatives in simulations.
