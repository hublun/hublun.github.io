Sales, profit and MROI are directly and indirectly impacted by many things.  Promotion, pricing, product, operational, economic, competitive, seasonality, weather and other external factors can all have direct or indirect effects on marketing.  To accurately measure marketing ROI and its impact on sales, all of these variables need to be measured and accounted for using one integrated and unified measurement framework.
Media Saturation and Lagging
It is likely that the effect of a media channel on sales could have a lagged effect which tapers off slowly over time. Our powerful Bayesian MMM model architecture is designed to capture this effect and offers three different approaches. We recommend users compare all three approaches and use the approach that works the best. The approach that works the best will typically be the one which has the best out-of-sample fit (which is one of the generated outputs). The functional forms of these three approaches are briefly described below and are fully expressed in our model documentation.

- Adstock: Applies an infinite lag that decreases its weight as time passes.
- Hill-Adstock: Applies a sigmoid like function for diminishing returns to the output of the adstock function.
- Carryover: Applies a causal convolution giving more weight to the near values than distant ones.

Here's a useless table:

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
