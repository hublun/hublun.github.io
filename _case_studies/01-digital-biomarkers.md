Partnered with clinical, regulatory, and data science leaders to stand up a reusable analytics platform spanning ingestion, modeling, and stakeholder reporting.

## Challenge

Global biopharma companies face increasing pressure to leverage digital biomarkers for clinical trials, but traditional analytics infrastructure can't keep pace with the volume and complexity of sensor data.

## Approach

- Designed a scalable data ingestion pipeline for wearable device data
- Built reproducible modeling workflows for biomarker validation
- Created automated reporting dashboards for clinical and regulatory teams

## Impact

The platform reduced time-to-insight by 6x while meeting regulatory requirements, enabling faster decision-making in clinical development.
