Designed and deployed a sophisticated revenue management system that combines dynamic pricing algorithms, demand forecasting, and competitive intelligence to maximize profitability across 200+ properties.

## Challenge

The hospitality chain relied on manual pricing decisions and legacy revenue management tools that couldn't adapt to real-time market conditions, seasonal patterns, or competitive dynamics. This resulted in suboptimal pricing strategies that left significant revenue on the table.

## Approach

- Built ML-powered demand forecasting models incorporating historical booking patterns, local events, weather data, and economic indicators
- Developed dynamic pricing algorithms that adjust rates in real-time based on booking velocity, competitive positioning, and inventory constraints
- Integrated web scraping and API data to monitor competitor pricing across OTAs and direct channels
- Created automated optimization workflows that recommend price adjustments while respecting brand positioning guardrails
- Implemented A/B testing framework to validate pricing strategies across property segments

## Impact

The revenue optimization engine drove a 27% increase in RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) within the first year, while occupancy rates improved by 8%. The system now processes over 2 million pricing decisions daily and has become a competitive differentiator for the brand.
