## Engagement Overview
- **Institution**: Troy University, Sorrell College of Business
- **Researchers**: C.J. Duan and Graham Sterling Pierce
- **Duration**: Multiple semesters of implementation and refinement
- **Publication**: Academic paper on innovative teaching methodology

## Challenge

First impressions matter in education. Traditional operations management courses often begin with dry syllabus reviews and theoretical lectures that fail to engage students or demonstrate the real-world relevance of OM concepts. Students struggle to see how abstract principles like productivity measurement, supply chain management, and workforce motivation apply in practical settings.

## Our Approach

Developed an innovative teaching methodology centered around "The Work Song Nanocluster" episode (Season 2, Episode 18) of the sitcom *The Big Bang Theory*, where characters help Penny grow her hair accessories startup into a full-fledged operation.

**Key Teaching Elements:**

1. **Legal Compliance** – Ensured full compliance with the TEACH Act for educational use of copyrighted materials in classroom settings

2. **Pause-Discuss-Go Method** – Structured the episode into six key scenes, each illustrating specific OM concepts:
   - Scene 1: Third-party logistics and bailment principles
   - Scene 2: Labor productivity and profit margin calculations
   - Scene 3: Time-motion studies and assembly line optimization
   - Scene 4: Workforce motivation and the Hawthorne effect
   - Scene 5: E-commerce integration and marketing-operations interface
   - Scene 6: Profit sharing and employee motivation

3. **Interactive Learning** – Students computed real productivity metrics (4.9 units/hour pre-optimization vs. 5x improvement post-optimization) and analyzed supply chain mapping

4. **Conceptual Bridging** – Connected sitcom scenarios to historical OM innovations (Henry Ford's assembly line, interchangeable parts, work songs for motivation)

## Impact

**Quantitative Results:**
- 93% of students agreed/strongly agreed the episode contributed positively to their OM learning experience
- 91% recognized the supply chain management issues related to e-commerce
- 97% understood the impact of workforce morale on productivity
- 85% preferred the sitcom approach over traditional textbook introduction

**Qualitative Feedback:**
- *"I am engaged and excited to come to the next class"*
- *"I will definitely remember the episode"*
- *"Much more effective than reading first chapter of book"*
- Students retained **twice the information** compared to reading alone and **four times** more than traditional lectures

## Pedagogical Innovation

The methodology demonstrates that:
- Humor creates a relaxed learning environment and overcomes cultural barriers
- Audio-visual content dramatically improves information retention
- Pop culture references make abstract concepts concrete and memorable
- First-class engagement sets a positive tone for semester-long learning

This approach has been successfully replicated across multiple semesters and represents a scalable model for teaching complex business concepts through entertainment media.
