## Client Testimonial

*"On behalf of my wife and I, we would like to sincerely thank Dr. Duan, Mrs. Amy Hu, and you for the time you spent developing a distribution plan for our new floral operation. We have incorporated it into our operation and it appears to have significantly reduced our travel time and expenses in distribution our products to the Marvin Stores chain. Hopefully this will be an on-going study and we will be able to 'tweak' or alter the system based on your recommendations as our business grows. Again, thank you for your help. It is very much appreciated."*

## Engagement Snapshot
- **Client**: Enterprise SaaS platform (Series E)  
- **Duration**: 12-week modernization sprint + quarterly advisory  
- **Team**: Engagement lead, analytics engineer, revenue operations specialist, design researcher

## Challenge
The executive team ran three overlapping forecast processes—finance, product usage, and marketing attribution—leading to inconsistent board updates, stalled investments, and eroding stakeholder confidence.

## Our Approach
1. **Diagnostic Assessment** – Mapped data lineage across CRM, billing, telemetry, and campaign tooling; quantified accuracy gaps and cycle time.  
2. **Unified Data Model** – Built a semantic layer aligning ARR, NRR, pipeline, and adoption metrics; automated QA and reconciliation tasks.  
3. **Scenario Planning Workbench** – Delivered Bayesian forecast models with narrative outputs tailored for finance, product, and GTM leaders.  
4. **Change Enablement** – Facilitated cadence redesign, executive dashboards, and training to embed the new forecast process.

## Outcomes
- Forecast accuracy improved **18%** in two quarters while reducing manual spreadsheet work by 70%.  
- Board reporting shifted from defensive to proactive scenario planning.  
- Finance, product, and marketing adopted a shared prioritization framework anchored in the new data model.
