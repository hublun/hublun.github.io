## Engagement Snapshot
- **Client**: Enterprise SaaS platform (Series E)  
- **Duration**: 12-week modernization sprint + quarterly advisory  
- **Team**: Engagement lead, analytics engineer, revenue operations specialist, design researcher

## Challenge
The executive team ran three overlapping forecast processes—finance, product usage, and marketing attribution—leading to inconsistent board updates, stalled investments, and eroding stakeholder confidence.

## Our Approach
1. **Diagnostic Assessment** – Mapped data lineage across CRM, billing, telemetry, and campaign tooling; quantified accuracy gaps and cycle time.  
2. **Unified Data Model** – Built a semantic layer aligning ARR, NRR, pipeline, and adoption metrics; automated QA and reconciliation tasks.  
3. **Scenario Planning Workbench** – Delivered Bayesian forecast models with narrative outputs tailored for finance, product, and GTM leaders.  
4. **Change Enablement** – Facilitated cadence redesign, executive dashboards, and training to embed the new forecast process.

## Outcomes
- Forecast accuracy improved **18%** in two quarters while reducing manual spreadsheet work by 70%.  
- Board reporting shifted from defensive to proactive scenario planning.  
- Finance, product, and marketing adopted a shared prioritization framework anchored in the new data model.
